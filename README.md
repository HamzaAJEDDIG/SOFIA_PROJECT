# SOFIA_PROJECT
# Envirement
  - Code was built in python 3.8, all needed modules are in venv directory
  - This project combine different data sets from different telescopes such as Herschel, IRAM 30m, MIMIR instrument and Planck
  - The pipeline allows to compute the magnetic field stregth using DCF method                   #
                               the input :                                                                   
                                          1/. fits file of cub data containing velocity                      
                                          2/. fits file conataining the backgroud map                        
                                            (in this case Herscel data)                                      
                                          3/. table containing polarization data organize                    
                                                RA, DEC ,PA,  SIF_PA,  PDEG,  SIG_PDEG                       
                                          4/. fits file containing Planck data to be displayed (PA)
